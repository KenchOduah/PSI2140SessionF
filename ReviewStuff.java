/* 1. Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and displays 
 * if the provided integer is a prime number or not.

   2. Create a class that asks the user to enter a number. 
   Call a method isEven that returns true or false if the number is even.
   The return from isEven should be passed to printEven which will print
   "The number is even" if the number is even and "The number is odd" if the number is odd.
   Determination of what to print must be done based on the return from the isEven method.
